## 3.2 Performance Analysis Results
### 3.2.1 Matrix Size Impact on Performance
The Gaussian filter demonstrates excellent parallel scaling, while matrix computation shows limited benefits from multithreading:

| Operation | Matrix Size | Speedup | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Matrix Computation | 10 | 0.008× | Severe parallel overhead |
| Matrix Computation | 20 | 0.027× | Minimal improvement |
| Matrix Computation | 30 | 0.032× | Still highly inefficient |
| Gaussian Filter | 10 | 3.53× | Good parallel scaling |
| Gaussian Filter | 20 | 3.78× | Excellent scaling |
| Gaussian Filter | 30 | 3.82× | Near-optimal performance |

**Key Finding**: Gaussian filtering achieves 3.5-3.8× speedup, demonstrating effective parallelization, while matrix computation suffers from excessive parallelization overhead.

### 3.2.2 Image Size Impact on Performance
Larger images show better parallel efficiency due to reduced relative overhead:

| Operation | Image Size | Speedup | Efficiency Trend |
|-----------|------------|---------|------------------|
| 90° Rotation | 512×512 | 0.61× | Poor scaling |
| 90° Rotation | 1024×1024 | 0.77× | Moderate improvement |
| 90° Rotation | 2048×2048 | 1.67× | Better but suboptimal |
| Gaussian Filter | 512×512 | 3.23× | Good performance |
| Gaussian Filter | 1024×1024 | 3.30× | Improved scaling |
| Gaussian Filter | 2048×2048 | 3.52× | Excellent scaling |

| **Key Finding**: Gaussian filtering maintains 3.2-3.5× speedup across image sizes, while rotation shows poor parallel efficiency except for largest images.

### 3.2.3 Overall Performance Summary
